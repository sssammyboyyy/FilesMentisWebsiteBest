## üí∞ ROI CALCULATOR ASSET

### Quick Math for Paul:
```
CURRENT STATE:
- Inconsistent lead flow
- Long sales cycles (legal delays)
- Mix of projects vs retainers

WITH OUR SYSTEM:
- 5 qualified meetings/month = 60/year
- 20% close rate = 12 new clients/year
- Average client value: R[ASK HIM]
- Retainer potential: R[ASK HIM]/month

EXAMPLE:
If avg client = R50k initial + R10k/month retainer
12 clients = R600k initial + R1.44M annual retainer
= R2.04M additional revenue
Investment = R[YOUR PRICE]
ROI = [CALCULATE]%
```
