# PAUL - TALKING POINTS: ASSET-BASED LEAD GEN

## üéØ **WHY 12% PERFORMANCE FEE?**

### **"Paul, here's why 12% is perfect for both of us:"**

1. **Risk-Free for You**: "Only pay when I actually bring you revenue - no monthly retainers"

2. **Aligned Incentives**: "I only make money when you close deals, so I'm motivated to send you quality prospects"

3. **Limited Time**: "Only applies to first 3 months per client - after that, they're 100% yours forever"

4. **Fair Split**: "You keep 88% of revenue I generate, which is higher than most agency partnerships"

5. **Covers My Costs**: "12% covers my system operations, AI tools, data costs, and time investment"

## üöÄ **ASSET-BASED SYSTEM BENEFITS**

## üí∞ **ROI EXPLANATION**

### **"Let me show you the math, Paul:"**

```
EXAMPLE CLIENT:
- Initial Project: R50,000
- Monthly Retainer: R10,000
- 3-Month Revenue: R80,000

YOUR COST:
- Performance Fee (12%): R9,600
- Your Net Revenue: R70,400

ONGOING VALUE:
- Month 4+: R10k/month = R120k/year
- Your Cost: R0 (100% profit)
- 5-Year Client Value: R600k+
```

### **"So you invest R9,600 once to earn R600k+ over 5 years"**

## üõ°Ô∏è **GUARANTEE EXPLANATION**

### **"Here's how confident I am in this system:"**

**"I guarantee 5 qualified meetings in 30 days, or you get your R5,000 setup fee back - no questions asked."**

**Qualified means:**
- Decision-maker with budget authority
- Active need for your services  
- Shows up to the meeting
- Matches your ideal client profile

## üéØ **EXCLUSIVITY BENEFIT**

### **"Paul, I only work with one agency per region"**

- **No Competition**: "Your competitors won't have access to this system"
- **Market Advantage**: "You'll be the only agency getting these qualified prospects"
- **Protected Territory**: "I won't work with other SA digital agencies"

## üî• **URGENCY CLOSES**

### **Option 1: Direct**
*"Paul, this system will fill your pipeline with retainer-ready clients. The setup fee is R5,000, performance is 12% for 3 months per client, and I guarantee results. Are you ready to start?"*

### **Option 2: Alternative**  
*"Would you prefer to start with 5 meetings per month or go straight to 8-10?"*

### **Option 3: Assumptive**
*"Perfect! I'll send you the contract after this call. Can you review it today so we can start generating leads this month?"*

## ü§ù **OBJECTION RESPONSES**

### **"12% seems high"**
*"I understand. Most agencies charge 15-20% ongoing. This is only 12% for 3 months, then drops to 0%. Plus, you're getting qualified meetings, not just contact lists."*

### **"What if the leads don't convert?"**  
*"That's exactly why I offer the 30-day guarantee. If my leads aren't qualified enough to convert, you get your money back. But based on your expertise with regulated industries, I expect strong conversion rates."*

### **"Can we negotiate the percentage?"**
*"Paul, you mentioned you're hot to close on lead gen. The 12% is fair for the value and includes the guarantee. Plus, I can offer this rate today only since you're ready to move forward."*

## ‚ö° **FINAL PUSH**

*"Paul, you're dealing with inconsistent leads and legal approval delays. My system solves both - consistent pipeline of pre-qualified decision-makers. R5,000 setup, 12% for 3 months, then they're yours forever. Are you in?"*
